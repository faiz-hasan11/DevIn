* Developers can emerge in any part of the world . Hence to keep developers connected with one another a ChatApp has been integrated . This will help fellow developers to communicate with others and share their ideas and even work on projects together. Multiple users can chat with one another at the same time in unanimous chat room.
* Keeping in mind the privacy of users while connecting with one another , users can enter the chatroom with any custom name regardless of their authenticated name.
* Bugs are inevitable issues in computer world. Hence a questionnare has been provided where users can ask their issues and post them and fellow developers can help them solve it. Others developers who may encounter similar issue may also be benefit from it.
